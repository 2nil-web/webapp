# A quick user documentation for webapp

### 1. <ins>**The -h option output**</ins>  
   **webapp 0.1.1-first-public-release**  
   A tool to create standalone applications based on web technology.  
   <ins>Usage:</ins> webapp [OPTIONS] ARGUMENT  
   <ins>Available options</ins>  
   <code>-h Print this message and eventually exit.
   -v Display version information and eventually exit.
   -b Provide additional browser arguments to the webview2 component.
   -c Provide an html string that will be directly set to the webview.
   -f Provide a url (a remote one must prepended with 'http://').
   -p Provide the path where could be found a file with a name within the following ones: webview.min.html, webview.html, index.min.html, index.html, index.min.js, index.js.
    The use of these 3 previous options is mutually exclusive.
    It is also possible to directly provide their argument as the last one of the command (hence witout the option), but prepended with "html://", for -c.
   -t Set the title of the webview windows, default is to display the url as title if it is provided or nothing if just an html string is provided.
   -j Inject a javascript command before loading html page.
   -r Run the provided javascript command and exits.
   -d Activate the developper mode in the webview.
   -l Set the log level. Their precedence is: ALL < TRACE < DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL < OFF.
   -g Set the log file name.
   -q Alias for -l OFF.
    These three previous option may also be set by the environment variables 'LOG' and 'LOGFILE' but the options have precedence on the environment.
    If neither the environment nor the options are set then relies on the debug option if it is used to set the log level to 'DEBUG'.
   -u List and briefly explain all the javascript objects extending the webview.
   -n Set windows icon with the provided .ico file.
   -m The webview window will be minimized at startup.
   -M The webview window will be maximized at startup.
   -s The webview window will not be shown at startup.
   -k Set webview hints => 0: width and height are default size, 1 set them as minimum bound, 2 set them as maximum bound. 3 they are fixed. Any other value is ignored.
   -a Do not generate javascript class instanciation for the webview extension functions</code>

### 2. **<ins>Some indications</ins>**  
   *Regarding the added variables and functions to this webview app:*  
   **a)** To test them you may encapsulated their result in [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) within any output function such as console.log or through the DOM. Something similar to the following:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code><ins>cls();console.log("Reworked content of the 'PATH' environment variable (path separators replaced by newlines):");console.log(`${env.path.replace(/;/g, "\n")}`)</ins></code>  
   **b)** Notice that when calling one of the functions, you have to deal with their asynchronous context by using  [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) or the [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) keyword in an [asynchronous function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function). Basically if you expect a return from any of these function you must call it in an asynchronous way. The only context that could allows you to avoid using asynchronous mode would be by calling a function that you do not expect its return, for instance '<code>app.set_title("New title")</code>, if you don't need to know the old title'.  

### 3. **<ins>The -u output</ins>**  
   <ins>List of the variables and functions for the objects extending the webview</ins>  
   *<ins>Variables:</ins>*  
   Read-only ones are prepended by a '-'*  
   <code>-app.sysname: provide the name of the system, this may help to assert in your javascript code that you are running a webapp, something like console.log(typeof app.system === 'undefined'?'not a webapp':'is a webapp').
   -app.x: horizontal position of the upper left corner of the webapp window.
   -app.y: vertical position of the upper left corner of the webapp window.
   -app.w: horizontal position of the lower left corner of the webapp window.
   -app.h: vertical position of the upper left corner of the webapp window.
   All these coordinate variables are updated in real time. To assert it, try something like:
   <ins>(async()=>{ elt=document.createElement('i'); document.body.appendChild(elt); new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { (function _(){ coords=`(${app.x}, ${app.y}, ${app.w}, ${app.h})`; if (elt.innerText != coords) { elt.innerText=coords; } timeoutId=setTimeout(_, 10); })(); }) })()</ins>
   And to stop it, later:
   <ins>clearTimeout(timeoutId); elt.remove()</ins>
   -app.title: title of the webapp window, usually displayed one its title bar.
   -app.icon: file name of the icon used by the webapp.
   -app.info: informations about the webapp.
   -app.state: contains the state of the application windows, may have one of the following values: normal, maximised, minimised, hidden, full_screen
   -app.last_error: may contains the last app object error
   -env.path: actual value of the PATH environment variable
   -fs.last_error: may contains the last fs object error
   -fs.cwd: current working directory</code>
